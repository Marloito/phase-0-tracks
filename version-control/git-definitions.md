# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to organize code, and keep a history of updates. If something in a code-base breaks, this allows programers to locate the issue, and roll-back the code if necessary. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copied repository that allows programmers to update different areas of code at the same time. After this is done, the updated code can be reviewed and merged back into the master branch (codebase).

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a save-point for code changes. This way code can be rolled-back if necessary. A good commit includes a short and meaningful message as to what was changed in the code. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when updates from different branches overlap causing GIT not to know which change to implement. This often happend when different programmers update the same sections of code in different ways.
