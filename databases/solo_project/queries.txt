1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
	INPUT
		SELECT * FROM students;
	OUTPUT
		1|Paul Brown|true|1
		2|Frank Caneloni|true|2
		3|Gordon Simon|false|3
		4|Sara Bragg|false|2
		5|Carry Smith|true|3	

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	INPUT
		UPDATE students SET applied_to_college = "true" WHERE name = "Sara Bragg";
	OUTPUT
		none -- but new row display is below <SELECT * FROM students WHERE id=4;>

		4|Sara Bragg|true|2

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
	INPUT
		SELECT * FROM students,
		highschool WHERE students.highschool_id = highschool.id;
	OUTPUT
		1|Paul Brown|true|1|1|Castle Highschool
		2|Frank Caneloni|true|2|2|Kapiolani Highschool
		3|Gordon Simon|false|3|3|Aiea Highschool
		4|Sara Bragg|true|2|2|Kapiolani Highschool
		5|Carry Smith|true|3|3|Aiea Highschool	

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
	INPUT
		SELECT students.name, highschool.name 
		FROM students JOIN highschool 
		ON students.highschool_id = highschool.id; 
	OUTPUT
		Paul Brown|Castle Highschool
		Frank Caneloni|Kapiolani Highschool
		Gordon Simon|Aiea Highschool
		Sara Bragg|Kapiolani Highschool
		Carry Smith|Aiea Highschool	

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	INPUT
		DELETE FROM students
		WHERE name = "Frank Caneloni";
	OUTPUT
		none -- but new table display below <SELECT * FROM students;>
		
		1|Paul Brown|true|1
		3|Gordon Simon|false|3
		4|Sara Bragg|true|2
		5|Carry Smith|true|3
